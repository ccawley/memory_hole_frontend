# MemoryHole

MemoryHole is a mobile first web app that provides an all-in-one daily gratitudes, goals, reflections, and journaling experience. Drawing from concepts of positive psychology, cognitive, and behavioral science, MemoryHole guides your mornings and evenings in such a way that you've set yourself up to have an intentional, happy, and productive day. You can then look back at any day and be presented with a look at what that specific day of your life was like.
